This is a simple page to try connecting to the github api.

* This uses the very modern framework of "Javascript in a stadards-compliant browser"
* The code is mostly self-documenting.

# Using

I'd like to think that, though spartan, the UI is self explanatory.

# Run it for yourself

1. Download: clone the repo, or copy the `index.html` file.
2. Install: No installation necessary
3. Run:
   * open it in a browser, or
   * python 3 `python3 -m http.server`
   * python 2 `python2 -m SimpleHTTPServer`
   * node `node -r http-server` (but you have to install that package)
